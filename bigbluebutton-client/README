Developing the client
1. Copy src/conf/config.xml.dev to src/cong/config.xml

Implementing Tab Order:
The default tab order (necessary for accessibility) is hard-coded into these modules and the main toolbars, and is as follows:
	Main Toolbar
	Viewers list window
	Listeners list window
	Webcam window
	Presentation window
	Whiteboard toolbar
	Chat window
	Bottom Toolbar

If you want to change the tab order for BigBlueButton , check resources/config.xml.template and it to src/conf/config.xml.
Certain modules must have the baseTabIndex property, and for the default tab order, their values should be as follows:  

	101: ViewersModule		(Viewers list window)
	201: ListenersModule	(Listeners list window)
	301: VideodockModule	(Webcam window)
	401: PresentModule		(Presentation window)
	501: WhiteboardModule	(Whiteboard toolbar)
	601: ChatModule			(Chat window)

The 100-value separation guarantees enough space for a sufficient number of elements in each module. The Main Toolbar's
base index is 1, the bottom toolbar's base index is 100,000, but you shouldn't need to change them anyway.
