bbb_api.jsp from bigbluebutton-web is different to the one in for bbb-api-demo

The method joinurl inside bbb_api.jsp has 3(bbb-api-demo version) or 5(bigbluebutton-web) parameters

Now I am using the one in bbb-api-demo

demo1.jsp demo2.jsp create.jsp(the fifth link) and demo6 are affected and does not work

Edit joinUrl method in bbb_api.jsp from bbb-api-demo

Declare String good_url

Change method parameters
	From
		String username, String meetingID, String welcome
	To
		String username, String meetingID, String record, String welcome, Map<String, String> metadata


Add record variable to String create_parameters  (it was in bbb_api.jsp from bigbluebutton-web)

Add conditional for metadata (it was in bbb_api.jsp from bigbluebutton-web)
